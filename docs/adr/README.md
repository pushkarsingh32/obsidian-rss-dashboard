# Architecture Decision Records

Documentation explains **how RSS Dashboard works**. Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) preserve **why it works that way**.

ADRs record important product, UX, architecture, storage, data-model, compatibility, and development decisions. They capture the problem that prompted a decision, the approach chosen, meaningful alternatives considered, and the consequences of that choice.

You do not need to be a developer to read them. Some ADRs are highly technical, while others document product behavior and design decisions that directly affect how RSS Dashboard works.

## How to read an ADR

Most ADRs follow the same basic structure:

- **Context and problem** — what prompted the decision and why it mattered.
- **Decision** — what RSS Dashboard chose to do.
- **Consequences** — what becomes better, worse, different, or deliberately unchanged.
- **Considered options** — other reasonable approaches that were evaluated.
- **Historical precedent** — relevant prior art or established conventions, when useful.
- **Implementation notes** — technical details maintainers may need, when useful.
- **Related** — connected ADRs, issues, documentation, or external references.

Not every ADR needs every optional section.

## ADR lifecycle

ADRs may have the following statuses:

- **proposed** — under consideration.
- **accepted** — adopted and represents current project policy.
- **superseded** — replaced by a newer ADR.
- **deprecated** — no longer recommended or relied upon.
- **rejected** — formally considered but not adopted.

Once accepted, ADRs are historical records. If a decision later changes materially, a new ADR should supersede the previous one rather than rewriting the original decision with hindsight.

See the [ADR Policy](POLICY.md) for the complete lifecycle, authoring, and maintenance rules.

## Creating a new ADR

Before creating an ADR, read the [ADR Policy](POLICY.md) to determine whether the decision warrants a durable record.

Start from [ADR-TEMPLATE.md](ADR-TEMPLATE.md), assign the next unused four-digit number, and use a descriptive kebab-case filename:

`NNNN-short-decision-title.md`

Example:

`0012-example-decision-title.md`

When the ADR is added or its status changes, update the index above.

## References and further reading

RSS Dashboard's ADR approach is informed by established ADR practices while intentionally keeping the process lightweight:

- [Michael Nygard — Documenting Architecture Decisions](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions)
- [MADR — Markdown Architectural Decision Records](https://adr.github.io/madr/)
- [ADR Templates](https://adr.github.io/adr-templates/)

RSS Dashboard uses these as influences rather than as a rigid external standard. The project's own requirements are defined in the [ADR Policy](POLICY.md).
